            <h2>Core Skills Overview</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                In this blog entry, I will be talking about my experience in learning core aspects during my 
                studies at Dev Academy so far.
            </p>
            <h3>3 Things I Learned</h3>
            <p>
                One thing I learned is that, before Dev Academy, I wasted too much time due to overvaluing 
                technical knowledge over planning. Recently, I've been learning about how to write code 
                following a process. Before that however I would always just jump straight into writing the 
                solution and perfecting it all in go with no prior planning, because of confidence about my 
                technical knowledge. However this was why I made many mistakes and why I take too much time 
                to write solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another thing I learned was that I'm too harsh on myself at times. I always felt dumb and 
                unaccomplished whenever I wasn't managing to make things work no matter how much time and 
                effort I put in, especially when I was at university. But having learned about things like the 
                growth mindset and neuroplasticity, I feel that I truly am capable of growth and improvement 
                as a person, but I just need to change the way I approach things, such as taking things one 
                step at a time rather than shoot for the end goal.
            </p>
            <p>
                One last thing I learned was that time management is my pitfall. At university, they'd always 
                just hand us large assignments without suggestion on how we should manage our times. If Dev 
                Academy did not teach me things like timeboxing, I feel I would not be meeting the deadlines 
                I have met so far.
            </p>
            <h3>Values, Empathy and Self Awareness</h3>
            <p>
                In learning and programming, it is easy to lose control of workload, time, relationships, and 
                your own health. But values, empathy and self-awareness can prevent this. Values give you 
                direction in terms of making important, independent decisions and setting standards for 
                yourself and the people around you. Empathy sustains healthy relationships with the people 
                around you, creating great learning progress and a stable working environment. Self-awareness 
                means you keep in check with yourself, what you're doing right or doing wrong, so that you do 
                not end up burning out and getting frustrated.
            </p>
            <h3>What surprised me the most</h3>
            <p>
                Seeing results from all the core skills suggested. People have always told me to manage my 
                work and time better, but I did not see any success because I did not know how to do that. 
                When I finally learned how to in core skills, I saw how much easier and more manageable things 
                became, which really surprised me.
            </p>
            <h3>The most challenging aspect</h3>
            <p>
                Exploring my own values, which were overall honesty, patience and empathy. I am quite an 
                anxious person and find it hard at times to find a solid grounding in my own values.
            </p>
            <h3>Learning core skills for programming</h3>
            <p>
                Having gone through hell at university, I see exactly why Dev Academy focuses so much on core 
                learning. In a traditional learning environment, it seems as if things like grades and 
                assignments are always singled out as the priority, and you either do well because you're 
                intelligent, or you do bad because you're dumb. This is especially true with programming as 
                it can get incredibly difficult and tiresome. Dev Academy teaches core skills so that people 
                know how to manage their work and time, which means that even the less experienced or 
                intelligent people are able to catch up and not burn out. The old me would think that 
                practicing programming repeatedly would make me a successful programmer, and that these core 
                skills are a waste of time. But that is not true at all. At the end of the day, core skills 
                should always be prioritised. I am an incredibly motivated and hard-working person, and feel 
                that if I stay true to that, and apply the core skills that I have learned, I will be 
                successful.
