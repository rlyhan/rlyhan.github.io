            <h2>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>What is Neuroplasticity?</h3>
            <p>
                Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to adapt throughout life, through formation 
                and strengthening of what we call 'neural pathways'.   
            </p>
            <p>
                Firstly, we think of the brain as containing many neurons (cells of the nervous system) 
                connected to other neurons across the body, as well as within the brain, via neural pathways. 
                When we try new things, we create new neural pathways. When we practice these things, these 
                neural pathways are travelled more frequently and thus the connection from neuron to neuron 
                becomes faster -- in other words, memory is improved, creating what we call a habit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Being aware of this can be a true benefit to everyone. It just goes back to that old adage, 
                "practice makes perfect". When we want to do things like improve our memory, change our 
                thinking habits, deal with emotions better, or get better at a hobby or work-related tasks, 
                we have to strengthen our neural pathways, and thus it leads to us being stronger as people.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many ways I could use neuroplasticity for my personal benefit. I think that making 
                use of timeboxing could help with my time organisation skills and eliminate distractions, 
                leading to a healthy balance between studying and life and eliminating stress, and the best 
                way to do that is by forcing myself to put it into practice every day, setting up small 
                deadlines throughout the day. Another thing I could use it is for communication skills. I 
                consider myself a pretty awkward person which can be pretty bad for socialising, learning 
                and working. The obvious solution to this is by practicing talking to people more often. 
                But I also need to become consistently being aware of how to communicate properly, and to do 
                that I would probably need to watch a YouTube video or read an article about it, perhaps every 
                day, to burn that memory into my head, ie. create and strengthen that pathway.

            <h3>What is the Growth Mindset?</h3>
            <p>
                Psychologist Carol Dweck talked about the difference between a fixed mindset and a growth 
                mindset. She referred to a fixed mindset as thinking that your abilities, talents and 
                intelligence are fixed, meaning you need to have a certain amount of those things. In 
                contrast, a growth mindset is that abilities, talent and intelligence is developed through 
                persistence and hard work.
            </p>
            <img src="../images/neuroplasticity-growthmindset/growth-diagram.jpg">
            <p>
                This is relevant when it comes to self-improvement. Having a fixed mindset can make one 
                prone to feeling incompetent for not being the ideal version of themselves and in turn they 
                refuse to put in the effort it takes to become that ideal version. A growth mindset however 
                says that you can become that ideal version of yourself if you put in consistent effort. It 
                also emphasises a focus on the progress involved instead -- This means celebrating each small 
                achievement that shows an improvement of what you were before, which makes you a lot more 
                confident about what you are now, rather than hating yourself for not yet being the perfect 
                you.
            </p>
            <p>
                I realised from thinking about this, that I had the growth mindset in some areas of my life, 
                and lacked in others. A few that I had included learning and practising full stack JavaScript, 
                weightlifting, and learning musical instruments. I found myself becoming better and better at 
                these things due to consistent focus on progress through consistently seeking challenge, 
                putting in hard work to improve and learning and persisting through shortcomings. However I 
                lacked this in other areas such as communication skills, time management and opening myself 
                up to different hobbies and habits. I think that if I start prioritising a growth mindset in 
                those areas, and start to become aware of and ignore any 'fixed mindset' ideas, I will see 
                much greater improvement on who I am as a person.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will especially use this during my learning journey. Time management is obviously the 
                biggest factor I am concerned with, so instead of just slacking off at times, I need to put 
                in more effort into using timeboxing. If I do well, celebrate it and look forward to improving, 
                but if not, try again, harder and smarter. In turn, better management of time will help me 
                focus more on the quality of my work, which will improve if I also apply the same mindset.
