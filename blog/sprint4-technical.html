          <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
          <br>
          <h3>How I solved a problem I got blocked on</h3>
            <p>
                In this problem, I had a gradebook containing a list of four students, eg. the first student 
                in the list is named Thomas. There was a separate list of four sets of test scores, eg. the 
                first set of scores was [80, 70, 70, 100]. I had to add each score set to a student respective 
                of the list ordering, eg. since Thomas is the first student in the list, his set of scores is 
                the first set, [80, 70, 70, 100].
            </p>
            <p>
                I already had the logic in my head to solve the problem. I had to go through each student in 
                the gradebook, get the number (ie. the index) indicating the student's position in the 
                gradebook, retrieve the set of scores at the position indicated by the index, and add it to 
                the student.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had issues with this because the gradebook was defined as a JavaScript object. I did not know 
                how to get the index of a value in an object.
            </p>
            <p>
                I used Google to find the answer. I felt a little frustrated here as I could not find an 
                answer quickly. It wasn't until I clearly defined my problem, based on the logical solution 
                I was trying to implement (going through a set of values and getting each value's index) and 
                the particular problem I was having (getting an index from a value in a JavaScript object) 
                that I was finally able to find an answer. So, I searched something like <strong>"javascript 
                object iterate index".</strong> After looking through a few links, I found what I wanted, and 
                it was something that I had never seen before, but I decided to try it out.
            </p>

            <p>
                I incorporated this into my code and it ended up working, I successfully managed to get the 
                index from each value in the gradebook. I learned that to solve a particular problem when 
                coding, you have to know your issue. And when getting help, you should be able to explain 
                what you are trying to do and the particular concept you are having an issue with when trying 
                to do that particular thing.
            </p>
            <h3>How I solved a problem in an elegant way</h3>
            <p>
                I was working on a piece of code where I had to <strong>capitalise the first letter of every 
                word in a sentence</strong>. I could have used some very basic coding techniques to solve 
                it, but it would have looked horrendous, horribly long, and have had a great potential for 
                error.
            </p>
            <p>
                To solve the problem elegantly, I wanted to use things called functions. which would each 
                change a particular detail of the sentence, and use a different function step by step to 
                transform the code. I was suggested to use the functions <strong>split,</strong> and 
                <strong>join</strong>, all of which I were not familiar with, along with <strong>map</strong> 
                and <strong>toUpperCase</strong>, which I was already familiar with. After researching online, 
                I figured out how to use these functions and how to capitalise the first letter of all words, 
                and solved the problem.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, I wrote some <strong>pseudocode</strong> of the solution. Pseudocode is not actual 
                code, but it is best described as, if code was transformed into simple, plain English. It is 
                structured like code, but the actual text are just sentences describing exactly what is 
                happening. In the pseudocode below, I described what the functions were doing as well as 
                other actions.
            </p>
            <img src="../images/problem-solving/fig-2.png">
            <p>
                I then started writing the code one by one, by converting each line of pseudocode into actual 
                code. To ensure each line of the code was working as expected, I used <strong>console.log
                </strong>, which prints to the coding program whatever you want. For example, to make sure that 
                the split function was correctly splitting a sentence <strong>eg. "hello hello"</strong>, I 
                used console.log on the <em>result of the splitting</em> to ensure I was seeing the desired 
                result, <strong>eg. console.log"hello","hello"</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Following the method, I managed to get the code working. But the code was longer than necessary 
                because every action was written independent from the other. To simplify the code, I used 
                <strong>chaining</strong> so that each function was joined to each other, so the code could 
                happen on just one line.
            </p>
            <img src="../images/problem-solving/fig-3.png">
            <p>
                Here, I learned that problem solving for complex problems is done best in a step by step 
                manner, which slows the pace to make it easy to understand what's going on. And then only 
                shorten the solution once you have actually got the solution working. It might be overwhelming 
                to write something like the piece of code above in just one quick go.
            </p>
            <h3>Problem Solving Concepts</h3>
            <p>Here I am describing how confident I am with the following methods of problem solving.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Pseudocode</strong>: I know how to write fairly good pseudocode, but I do not use it 
                that often. I think it would be useful to write it more often to perfect it, especially when 
                I solve more complex problems in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Trying something</strong>: As demonstrated above, trying something definitely helps 
                in cases that cannot be solved through the knowledge you already have. I was not confident 
                about this method before using it like I just did, but I feel more confident about it now.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Rubber ducky</strong>: I have yet to try this but I can see how it works. I feel 
                fairly confident that it would work.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Reading error messages</strong>: I am confident in reading some error messages, such 
                as unit test messages and errors indicating which line something went wrong on. I am a little 
                less confident about more ambiguous error messages such as range errors or reference errors, 
                but with practice I am sure I will be fine.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Console.logging</strong>: I use this method all the time so I am 100% confident with 
                it.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Googling</strong>: As shown above, finding the answer on Google takes a bit more work 
                than you think. You need to clearly define your problem and intention before knowing what kind 
                of answer you want. I used to just Google whatever came to my head, but now that I've done it 
                in a cohesive manner I feel more confident.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Asking peers for help</strong>: I am not the best at describing my problems 
                cohesively, so I'm not too confident about asking for help. I only feel relatively confident 
                when I've tried practically everything I can think of and can think of no better way.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Asking coaches for help</strong>: I have not really tried this at all or had it come 
                to my mind so don't really feel confident nor unconfident about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Improving my process with reflection</strong>: Having done a lot of reflecting 
                throughout these past few weeks, I think it has improved my memory with things. I have yet 
                to master it completely, but am feeling slightly more confident with it than I was previously.
