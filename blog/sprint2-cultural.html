            <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
            <br>
            <p>My long term goal is to be a full stack JavaScript developer with the skills and knowledge to have a choice between working either freelance, remote or at a company. </p>
            <p>One skill I would like to develop is collaboration, in the sense of allocating jobs to each other, managing each other's time, and being assertive. I also want to develop greater self-dependence, not having to rely on peers too much for help and managing my own time to stay up to date. My strengths include strong concentration and commitment to my work (especially with peers) and being understanding of others. My limitations include working too hard to the point where it can ruin my personal time management and motivation, and going with the flow a little too often when collaborating rather than giving my own advice.</p>
            <p>In order to manage the workload in this programme, I will have to follow a certain plan. To be reliable towards myself, my peers, facilitators and people in the industry/community, I will ensure that I follow a schedule by getting in the recommended hours of work each day, as well as extra work in my own time, in order to ensure sure I am up to date with all the tasks. To make sure that this time is used effectively, I will take the time to plan out my day's worth of tasks and assess how realistically I will achieve my goals in a certain timeframe, such as the entire week. This in turn will also help me devise what times are good to take any breaks and organise my life outside Dev Academy so I do not get fatigued or stressed out, and minimise conflict with others</p>
            <p>To seek help in a timely manner, I must plan ahead with the things I need any help with. I can do this during my assessment of the week ahead. For instance, I could pick out material that is rather time-consuming or difficult, and talk with my facilitator or my peers as soon as possible with any questions or discussions in terms of problem solving, organising time and any other issues. </p>
            <p>What I expect from the facilitation team is a check-up on how I am progressing, recommendations on things I should be focusing my time and energy upon over other things and clarification on instructions that I do not quite understand. I do not expect them to give me any direct solutions or problem-solving, but when I do get very stuck on something I am expecting some form of guidance, especially when it could be things like technical issues.</p>
            <p>I will work around any commitments outside Dev Academy through, once again, assessment of my to-dos during the week, and reshuffle these things when necessary to ensure I get enough work done during the day and over the week. For example, I could do grocery shopping and meal prepping on the weekend, change up my sleep schedule, or allocate more work hours on certain days to allow more time for any relatively time-consuming commitments outside Dev Academy.
